1) Task Understanding : Classification task
- you have to predict that wheather a passenger is transported to another dimension or not?

2) Understanding data :

train.csv - Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.
PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
Age - The age of the passenger.
VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.

test.csv - Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.

sample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format.
PassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.
Transported - The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.

3) How to know which features among given dataset are important ( which to ignore or which to keep)?
- Encode necessary columns in dataset.
- fill the null values.
- use correlation matrix : There are no highly positive correlated features so decided use dataset as it is.
- Or do it by your intuition.

4) Data-preprocessing :
-- Name column is dlt from main dataset.
- Home planet : Need to label encode column to make it numerical.
- Cryosleep : Need to label encode column to make it numerical.
- Destination: Need to label encode column to make it numerical.
- VIP : Need to label encode column to make it numerical.

-- All  features have few missing values except label(Transported),which needs to be filled.
-- consider to perform scaling of data before training model as it will improve model performance.
--- while imputing values,it is putting unconsiderable values in columns which should have only 2 values (have value 2 but it should be either 0 or 1)
-- Cleaned_train.xlsx=imputed with k=5
-- Cleaned_train(1).xlsx=imputed with k=3
--- Values remain same in both the conditions.

5) Classification model selection: Seems dataset is linear in nature and training accuracy is good with linear classifiers (SVM,LR,Kernal SVM)

6) Results:
   1) SVM(linear,kernal='linear') : Training accuracy = 78.19
                                  : model accuracy = 78.36 (on kaggle)

   2) SVM(non-linear,kernel='rbf') : Training accuracy = 77.01
                                   : Model accuracy = 79.354 (On kaggle)
